# Design Guidelines for AdaptlyLearn

## 1. General Design Overview
**Purpose:** An adaptive learning platform that personalizes educational content in real-time based on student performance, creating optimal learning paths for mastery.
**Tone & Personality:** Professional yet approachable, encouraging, data-driven, and trustworthy.
**User Goals:** Master subjects efficiently, track learning progress, receive personalized recommendations, build confidence through adaptive challenges.

### 1.1 Core Design Principles
- Clarity: Information hierarchy must be immediately understandable
- Progressive Disclosure: Show only what's relevant at each learning stage
- Encouragement: Positive reinforcement through micro-interactions and progress visualization
- Personalization: UI adapts to individual learning patterns and preferences

## 2. Color Scheme
**Primary:** Adaptly Blue - #2563EB - Navigation, primary buttons, key highlights
**Secondary:** Mastery Green - #10B981 - Success states, completed progress
**Accent:** Focus Orange - #F59E0B - Notifications, important actions, attention areas

## 3. Typography
### 3.1 Font Family
**Primary:** Inter (Clean, highly readable sans-serif)
**Secondary:** Source Serif Pro (For content body to enhance reading comprehension)
### 3.2 Font Weights & Hierarchy
- **H1:** 32px, Semibold - Page headers and main titles
- **H2:** 24px, Semibold - Section headers
- **Body:** 16px, Regular - Main content and explanations
- **Buttons/CTA:** 16px, Medium - Action buttons and navigation

## 4. UI Components by Page
### Learning Dashboard
- **Layout:** Three-column responsive layout with progress map (left), current module (center), and performance metrics (right)
- **Interactive Elements:** Progress slider, topic cards, recommendation carousel, confidence rating buttons
- **Color & Behavior:** Green for mastered topics, orange for current focus, gray for upcoming. Smooth transitions between states.
- **Mobile-First Notes:** Stack columns vertically, collapsible side panels, touch-friendly card sizes

### Module Detail Page
- **Layout:** Full-width content area with sticky progress bar and navigation controls
- **Interactive Elements:** Video player, interactive exercises, hint system, confidence slider
- **Color & Behavior:** Subtle color coding for difficulty levels, smooth transitions between questions
- **Mobile-First Notes:** Optimized video player, large touch targets for answers, simplified navigation

### Progress Analytics
- **Layout:** Data visualization dashboard with tabbed interface for different metrics
- **Interactive Elements:** Date range selectors, topic filters, export buttons
- **Color & Behavior:** Consistent color coding with learning dashboard, animated chart transitions
- **Mobile-First Notes:** Simplified single-column charts, touch-friendly filter controls

## 5. Mobile UX & Accessibility
- **Navigation:** Bottom navigation bar with key actions, swipe gestures for content navigation
- **Tap Targets:** Minimum 44px touch targets for all interactive elements
- **Contrast:** AA compliance minimum, with option for high contrast mode
- **Feedback:** Haptic feedback on interactions, clear visual states for all actions

## 6. Icons & Visual Style
- **Icon Set:** Rounded line icons with consistent stroke weight (2px)
- **Visual Guidelines:** Custom illustrations for empty states and achievements, limited photography use, data visualization takes priority

## 7. Microinteractions & Animations
- **Transitions:** Slide animations between modules, fade transitions for content changes
- **States:** Clear hover, active, and focus states with subtle scale and color changes
- **Animations:** Progress bar fill animations, celebration micro-animations for milestones

## 8. Performance Considerations
- **Optimization:** Lazy loading of video content, optimized images, efficient data fetching
- **Offline:** Basic content caching for recent modules, offline progress tracking

## 9. Security & Privacy Design
- **Auth Experience:** Clean, minimal login flow with clear privacy policy links
- **Data Safety:** Visual indicators for data saving states, clear privacy controls in settings

### Conclusion
The design must balance educational rigor with engaging user experience, ensuring trust through clear data presentation and reliability through consistent performance. The adaptive nature should feel empowering, not limiting, to the learner.
