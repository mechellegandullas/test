# Design Guidelines for AdaptIQ

## 1. General Design Overview
**Purpose:** To provide a personalized, adaptive learning experience that dynamically adjusts to each student's unique pace and comprehension level, maximizing knowledge retention and mastery through AI-driven content delivery.
**Tone & Personality:** Supportive, intelligent, and empowering. The interface should feel like a patient, expert tutor—always encouraging, never condescending.
**User Goals:** Master complex subjects efficiently, build confidence through personalized learning paths, track progress transparently, and achieve specific academic or certification goals.

### 1.1 Core Design Principles
- **Clarity:** Information and next steps must be immediately understandable. Avoid cognitive overload.
- **Minimalism:** The UI should recede, putting the learning content front and center. Remove all unnecessary elements.
- **Emotional Engagement:** Use positive reinforcement, celebrating milestones to build momentum and a growth mindset.

## 2. Color Scheme
**Primary (Confidence Blue):** #2563EB - Used for primary buttons, key highlights, and to instill a sense of calm, trust, and focus.
**Secondary (Neutral Gray):** #4B5563 - Used for body text, secondary information, and borders. Promotes readability without distraction.
**Accent (Growth Green):** #10B981 - Used exclusively for positive feedback, correct answers, and progress indicators to create a strong positive association.

## 3. Typography
### 3.1 Font Family
**Primary:** Inter. Chosen for its excellent readability on screens and clean, modern professionalism.
**Secondary:** System UI Monospace. Used only for displaying code snippets in programming modules.

### 3.2 Font Weights & Hierarchy
- **H1:** 2rem / 32px, Semibold (600) - Page titles and major section headers.
- **H2:** 1.5rem / 24px, Semibold (600) - Sub-section headers and lesson titles.
- **Body:** 1rem / 16px, Regular (400) - All primary content and instructional text.
- **Buttons/CTA:** 1rem / 16px, Semibold (600) - All interactive calls-to-action.

## 4. UI Components by Page

### Homepage / Student Dashboard
- **Layout:** A clean, card-based layout. The central focus is the "Continue Learning" card, prominently featuring the next recommended lesson. A progress bar for the current module is always visible at the top.
- **Interactive Elements:** "Continue" button (Primary Blue), module cards, navigation sidebar, profile menu.
- **Color & Behavior:** The dashboard uses a mostly white and light gray background. The "Continue" button is the most vibrant element on the page, drawing the eye. Module cards have a subtle hover effect (slight shadow elevation).
- **Mobile-First Notes:** The sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu. The "Continue Learning" card becomes full-width. Module cards stack vertically.

### Lesson Page
- **Layout:** A focused, single-column layout. The lesson content is central, with a persistent, slim progress bar at the very top of the viewport. Navigation controls (Next, Previous) are fixed at the bottom.
- **Interactive Elements:** Video player, interactive code sandbox (for STEM), multiple-choice question widgets, "Check Answer" button, "I'm Confident" / "I'm Struggling" feedback buttons.
- **Color & Behavior:** Upon answering a question, immediate feedback is given: a green checkmark and brief explanation for correct answers, a gentle red highlight and a hint for incorrect ones. The "Check Answer" button changes to "Next" after completion.
- **Mobile-First Notes:** The fixed bottom navigation becomes essential. Content is heavily padded to ensure comfortable reading and tapping.

### Analytics & Progress Page
- **Layout:** Data-dense but organized. Uses a combination of large metric cards (e.g., "Mastery Score: 87%"), line charts showing performance over time, and a heatmap of concepts (green for mastered, yellow for in-progress, red for struggling).
- **Interactive Elements:** Timeframe filters (e.g., Last Week, All Time), hover states on charts for detailed tooltips.
- **Color & Behavior:** Data visualization strictly uses the Growth Green, Neutral Gray, and Accent Red (#EF4444 for struggling concepts) for intuitive understanding. Interactions are smooth and informative.
- **Mobile-First Notes:** Charts stack vertically. Metric cards change to a 2-across grid. Tooltips are replaced by tap-to-reveal details.

## 5. Mobile UX & Accessibility
- **Navigation:** Bottom navigation bar on mobile for quick access to Home, Progress, and Profile. This is the most ergonomic solution.
- **Tap Targets:** All interactive elements maintain a minimum size of 44x44pt.
- **Contrast:** All text and UI elements exceed WCAG AA standards. Primary blue on white has a ratio of 4.5:1.
- **Feedback:** Every user action receives clear feedback: buttons have distinct active states, form fields have focus states, and all asynchronous actions (saving, loading) display a non-blocking progress indicator.

## 6. Icons & Visual Style
- **Icon Set:** "Feather" icon set. Style: Light, outline-based, consistent stroke width. They convey simplicity and clarity.
- **Visual Guidelines:** Avoid photorealistic imagery. Use abstract, geometric illustrations if needed to explain concepts. For user avatars, default to initials in a circle if no image is provided. No cartoons; the aesthetic is mature and focused.

## 7. Microinteractions & Animations
- **Transitions:** Subtle fade and slide transitions between pages to maintain context and flow.
- **States:** All buttons have a slight scale transform on press (active state) to feel tactile.
- **Animations:** Purposeful only. A celebratory confetti animation (tasteful and dismissible) for major milestones. A smooth progress bar fill for lesson completion.

## 8. Performance Considerations
- **Optimization:** All images and illustrations are served in modern formats (WebP/AVIF) and lazy-loaded. Video streams are adaptive bitrate.
- **Offline:** Core lesson text content is cached for offline reading. The UI will clearly indicate offline status and functionality limits.

## 9. Security & Privacy Design
- **Auth Experience:** The sign-up/login flow is minimal. Options include Email and Google OAuth. The first login explains the value of an account (saving your unique learning path).
- **Data Safety:** Privacy settings are easily accessible from the profile page. The platform uses clear, simple language to explain what data is collected (performance metrics) and why (to personalize learning). No data is shared without explicit, granular consent.

### Conclusion
The design of AdaptIQ must first and foremost build trust—trust that the platform is intelligent and effective, and trust that the student's data is safe. The experience should feel effortless, removing all friction between the student and their goal of mastery. Every design decision, from the calming color palette to the celebratory micro-interactions, must align with the core brand promise of being a supportive, personalized guide on the user's learning journey.
